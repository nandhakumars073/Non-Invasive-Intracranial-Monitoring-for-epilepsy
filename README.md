# Non-Invasive-Intracranial-Monitoring-for-epilepsy
A signal-processing-based framework for detecting epileptic seizures from EEG recordings. The project extracts time-domain and statistical features such as RMS, variance, energy, and entropy to differentiate normal, interictal, and seizure activity, providing an interpretable and reproducible research baseline.
